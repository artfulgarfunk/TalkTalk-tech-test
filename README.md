# Vending Machine

## An Object-Oriented Vending Machine program created in C#

# Design
This project was put together in less than 24 hours, with prior experience in C#. Please account for this as there are a great many design changes which I was unable to implement in time due to unfamiliarity with the language.

In order to object orient the process I considered
